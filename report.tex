\begin{letter}
I have completed my fifth work term, following my \theterm{} term. Please find
enclosed my fourth work term report entitled: ``\thetitle'' for \theemployer, a 
non-profit organization with the mission of providing "a free world-class 
education for everyone everywhere". My manager was B. Eater, and our team was 
primarily responsible with creating interactive content ("exercises") on the 
site.

This report focuses on selecting a service for hosting images to be used in 
exercises on Khan Academy. This problem is one that I encountered on my work 
term.

I wish to thank B. Eater and B. Alpert for their advice on the technical 
content of this report. I also wish to thank C. Kleynhans and M. Yee for 
recommending the use of the uw-wkrpt \LaTeX class to format this report.

% Note that I do not need to type out the boilerplate confirmation,
% nor do I need to write a signature block.  This is generated for me.
% We are now finished with the letter.
\end{letter}

% We continue with required sections, such as the Executive Summary.
\section{Executive Summary}
Khan Academy provides exercises to help learners practice and review concepts 
that they've learned. Historically, these exercises have been built using the 
BSD-licensed khan-exercises framework. It is difficult to find and retain 
people to contribute exercises using the framework, as they both need to know 
how to teach and how to program in JavaScript.

Khan Academy is developing new tools to allow teachers to contribute to 
exercises without knowing how to program in JavaScript. These tools allow 
teachers to build a large bank of questions, which can be bundled together into 
an exercise. The initial implementation of the question editor only allowed 
users to embed images by hotlinking them from somewhere else.

This document describes the selection of a hosting service for the images that 
are uploaded in the question editor. It describes the criteria by which the 
services were evaluated, and uses the multi-criteria decision-making 
methodology to rank the services.

% Next, we need to make a Table of Contents, List of Figures and 
% List of Tables.  You will most likely need to run LaTeX twice to
% get these correct.  The first pass for LaTeX to figure out the
% labels, and the second pass to put in the right references.

% You must have an Introduction
\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Khan Academy provides exercises to help learners practice and review concepts 
that they've learned. Historically, these exercises have been built using the 
BSD-licensed khan-exercises framework, with each problem being randomly 
generated. This works well for exercises that focus on computation, such as 
exercises for basic addition, vectors, and matrices. However, it is cumbersome 
for word problems in math, and even more so for other subjects, such as 
biology, chemistry, math, or history. Furthermore, people who wish to 
contribute exercises must both be proficient in teaching and in programming in 
JavaScript -- only a small fraction of contributions received meet both content 
and technical standards to be incorporated into Khan Academy.

\subsection{Static Questions}\label{sec:staticq}
Khan Academy is developing new tools to allow teachers to contribute to 
exercises without knowing how to program in JavaScript. These tools allow 
teachers to build a large bank of questions, and bundle questions together into 
exercises. These tools will enable more teachers to contribute content to Khan 
Academy, which will help Khan Academy reach complete coverage of High School 
mathematics sooner. These tools will also enable content creators to create 
exercises in topics, such as World War I, that are unsuitable for the 
programmatic creation of question content. This report focuses on one 
particular component of this toolkit -- the question editor.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \lstinputlisting{imgsyntax.md}
  \caption{Static Questions - Image Embed Syntax.}
  \label{fig:imgsyntax}
\end{figure}

The question editor uses a combination of Markdown syntax for formatting, and 
LaTeX syntax for mathematical formulas. The initial version of the question 
editor allowed images to be inserted by using the syntax shown in 
figure~\ref{fig:imgsyntax}. However, the syntax provided only allowed users to 
embed images by hotlinking them from another server, such as Dropbox.

\subsection{Problem Statement}\label{sec:problem}
Hotlinking is considered poor practice for a variety of reasons. In particular, 
it reduces site performance for Khan Academy users, due to the need for 
additional DNS lookups and HTTP connections. It also puts undue financial costs 
on the owner of the other server. In order to remove the need for content 
creators to hotlink images, Khan Academy needs to procure a hosting service for 
the images used in the static questions.

This report seeks to select an appropriate hosting provider for images included 
in static questions on Khan Academy.

The Khan Academy website is primarily written in Python, and hosted on Google 
App Engine.

% You must have either an Analysis or a Synthesis section.
\section{Analysis}
First, we develop criteria and consider various hosting providers. We use the 
weighted sum model,\footnote{This method is covered in MSCI 261, a core course 
in the software engineering curriculum at the University of Waterloo. If you 
need a refresher, you can read about it on Wikipedia at
\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_sum_model}.} a method of
multi-criteria decision making, to select an alternative.

\subsection {Criteria}
Criteria were selected based on past experience and overall organization 
priorities.

\subsubsection{Existing Relationship With Provider}
Do we already pay for services from this provider? Ranked from 1 (no prior 
relationship) to 5 (already use and pay for their services for mission-critical 
loads).

\subsubsection{Team Familiarity}
How much work would a developer need to learn how to use this service? Ranked 
from 1 (would need extensive training) to 5 (previously used in 
mission-critical loads).

\subsubsection{User Impact}
How do we think the user experience will be impacted by this alternative?
Questions are served thousands of times a day, and are written to / edited 
infrequently. Are the URLs for accessing resources stored on this service 
cacheable? Ranked from 1 (need to generate a new URL for every user) to 5 (URLs 
can be cached for at least one year).

\subsubsection{Tools}
How easy is it to administrate and manage the content hosted on the service?  
Ranked from 1 (requires assistance from hosting provider) to 5 (well-maintained 
web console and third-party tools available).

\subsubsection{Programmatic Access}
How easy is it to programmatically upload content to the service?
Ranked from 1 (web upload only) to 5 (documented API, with maintained libraries 
available, and revokable API keys for automated agents)

\subsubsection{Custom ACLs Support}
Ranked from 1 (binary account-wide full-access/no-access) to 5 (fine-grained 
per-file ACLs).

\subsection{Alternatives}
Possible solutions were generated by asking current employees about services 
they have used in the past (either professionally or personally).

\subsubsection{S3}
This service is provided by Amazon Web Services. S3 can be accessed using the 
boto library \cite{ref:botoreadme}. In addition to providing an API for 
uploads, this service supports Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow 
for direct uploads from users\cite{ref:s3cors}.

\subsubsection{Blobstore API (Google App Engine)}
This service is provided by Google as a part of its Google App Engine offering, 
and targeted towards larger uploads.  For Python users, the Blobstore API is 
accessed through a module provided with the Google App Engine SDK. End-users 
upload their files to an API-generated URL using a standard web form. Once the 
file is uploaded, Google notifies the application with a server-side callback.  
Blobs must be served by adding a download handler to a GAE application 
\cite{ref:gaeblob}, except for images, which can be served directly using the 
App Engine Images API \cite{ref:gaeimage}.

\subsubsection{Cloud Storage API}
This service is provided by Google, and can be accessed using the boto library 
\cite{ref:botoreadme}, as well as through a model provided with the Google App 
Engine SDK \cite{ref:gaecs}. Images can be served directly using the App Engine 
Images API cite{ref:gaeimage}.

\subsubsection{Imgur}
This service is provided by Imgur. Commercial API access is provided through 
Mashape.

\subsubsection{Dropbox}
This service is provided by Dropbox. Users can generate URLs for files using 
online, mobile, and desktop clients. Pricing is per-user, and tiered based on 
the amount of space used.

\subsection{Multi-Criteria Decision-Making}
We note that the MCDM usually isn't very robust if the criteria weights are 
changed -- in fact, it is possible to make most of the alternatives an 
"optimal" solution by changing the weights. However, we proceed with the 
weights chosen, noting that we should verify the validity of the criteria 
weights if we need to make a similar decision in the future.
